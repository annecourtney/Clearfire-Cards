Instructions and Guidelines:

1. Update the existing index.html file that is included, so that the end result is 3 vertically and horizontally centered "cards" in a row. On mobile, the 3 cards should re-oriente vertically so they are stacked on top of each other.

2. See the example.png for an example of what the final layout should look like on desktop.

3. Use the existing index.html as a starting point, along with the 3 images that are also included and linked in the index.html file.

4. Each "card" should at least consist of an image, heading, summary text, and button.

5. Feel free to import or use an existing framework like Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com) or Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com) for efficiency. Or code from scratch if that is your preference.

6. Final output should be a static index.html file that can be viewed in the browser without the need to run composer, compile source code, download dependancies, etc.

7. Final source code should be committed to a private repo for me to review. Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org) and GitLab (https://gitlab.com) provide free private repos if necessary. My username on both of those platforms and on Github is @caseyreid for when you are ready to invite me to view your code.

8. Use your best judgement in terms of the final visual output. The end result should be something you might see on a finished website. Add in appropriate styling or typography so that the "cards" look visually polished.
